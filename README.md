# 🧠 AutoStream Agent – Social-to-Lead AI Assistant

AutoStream Agent is a conversational AI system designed to convert user conversations into qualified leads.  
It simulates a real-world **sales assistant workflow** by identifying user intent, answering product questions using a knowledge base, and capturing lead details only when the user shows high purchase intent.

This project demonstrates **agent reasoning, deterministic state handling, and lead qualification logic**, aligned with real SaaS sales automation systems.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Intent classification (Greeting, Pricing Inquiry, High-Intent Lead)
- ✅ Knowledge-base grounded responses (no hallucinations)
- ✅ Multi-turn lead capture (Name → Email → Platform)
- ✅ State persistence across turns
- ✅ Deterministic control flow (no random behavior)
- ✅ Streamlit-based chat UI (no terminal interaction required)
- ✅ Easily extendable to WhatsApp / Web / APIs

## 🧩 Intent Capabilities

The agent correctly identifies and handles:

### 1. Casual Greeting
**Example:** `hi`, `hello`, `good morning`  
→ Responds politely without pushing sales.

### 2. Product / Pricing Inquiry
**Example:** `price`, `pricing`, `cost`, `plans`  
→ Responds using a **local knowledge base**.

### 3. High-Intent Lead
**Example:** `pro plan`, `want to subscribe`, `need basic`  
→ Triggers structured lead capture workflow.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The system follows a **deterministic agent architecture** with explicit state management.

### Core Components

### 🔹 Intent Detection Layer
Rule-based intent classification ensures predictable behavior and eliminates ambiguity during evaluation.

### 🔹 State Machine (Agent State)

The agent maintains structured state:

```python
{
  "intent": None,
  "awaiting": None,
  "name": None,
  "email": None,
  "platform": None
}
```
This guarantees:

- No repeated questions  
- No premature lead capture  
- Correct order of information collection  

---

### 🔹 Knowledge Base (RAG-lite)

Pricing and policy information is loaded from a local JSON file (`knowledge_base.json`).  
Responses are grounded in factual data, preventing hallucinations.

---

### 🔹 Lead Capture Tool

A mock lead capture function simulates backend CRM ingestion and can be easily replaced with real APIs.

---

### 🔹 Conversation Memory

`ConversationBufferMemory` stores conversation history for future LLM-based enhancements.

---

## 🖥️ Streamlit Chat Interface

The agent runs entirely inside a **Streamlit web app**, providing a clean chat experience:

- User messages and agent replies appear in real-time  
- Session state ensures memory persistence  
- No terminal input required  
- Ready for demo and evaluation
